= AppCDS Log Parser

This little app reads the JVM logs and produce a report about class loading.

== Building

You need Java 17

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw package
----

The generated jar is executable.

== Using

First, you need to produce the log of the target application.
By default, the tool look for a file named `cds.log` in the working directory.

Here is an example using a Spring Boot application that is using an AppCDS archive:

[indent=0]
----
	$ java -Xlog:class+load:file=cds.log:tags -XX:SharedArchiveFile=app-cds.jsa -jar my-app.jar
----

To run a report, specify the working directory where the `cds.log` file is located:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./appcds-log-parser.jar --target=/usr/local/my-app
----
